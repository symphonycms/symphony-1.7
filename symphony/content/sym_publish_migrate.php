			<p>This is the v1.1.00 Migration tool. Since there were a large number of changed in Symphony to do with <strong>muli-language support</strong>, the way Entries, Comments, Categories & Custom Fields are store in the database has changed. As a result, it is necessary to migrate them to the new format, otherwise your front end may not work as expected.</p>
			<p>Use the button below to begin the migration process. A <strong>backup of your database</strong> will be created in the <code>/symphony/tmp/</code> directory should something bad happen. Detailed information of this process can also be seen in your activity logs.</p>
			<p><strong>Note: Your Entries table data will be ALTERED DRAMATICALLY. You should do a full database backup of your own prior to using this tool. In the event that something horrible happens, and the Migration backup created is also corrupt, you wont have lost anything.</strong></p>
